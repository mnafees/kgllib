-- What is KGLLib --
KGLLib is an object-oriented OpenGL library designed to ease development of
OpenGL applications by providing common functionality. It uses Qt and provides
comfortable Qt-style API. It is also designed to be very extensible, so
applications wanting more functionality can extend it to suit their needs.


-- KGLLib status --
KGLLib is still in an early stage and under heavy development. As such, it's
API is still unstable and no binary or even source compatibility is kept for
now, although I'll try to minimize the number of source-incompatible changes.

As a rule of thumb, if API documentation exists for something, it can be
considered to be mature enough to be used. If API docs doesn't exist for a
class or method then it's highly experimental and could be changed or removed
in future versions.
API documentation is available at http://freehackers.org/~rivo/kgllib/html/

As KGLLib is highly volatile for now, applications wishing to use it should
copy it into their own source tree for now and merge with upstream once in a
while.


-- Core and extras --
KGLLib is divided into two big parts: core and extras. Core library consists of
the fundamental classes which are useful to a large number of applications.
Core classes are also more mature and stable than those in extras.
Extras include more classes and more diverse functionality, including classes
that have more specific purpose and won't be used by many applications.


-- Examples --
KGLLib comes with many examples which can be found in the examples/ directory.
At the moment some of those examples need to be run from their source
directories (otherwise they won't find their data files).
