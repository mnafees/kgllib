This directory contains sources for GLEW, The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library.

It is included here to remove GLEW from the list of KGLLib requirements and
thus ease it's installation.
If GLEW is already installed in the system, then the system version is used
instead.

GLEW's website is http://glew.sourceforge.net/
